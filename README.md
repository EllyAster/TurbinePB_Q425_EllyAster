## 📂 Current Projects

| 🧩 Project | 💡 Description | 🎯 Focus |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **RNG Game** | Number guessing game using Cargo and `rand`. | Randomness & input handling |
| **Counting Program** | Simple counting loop project. | Iteration & control flow |
| **Rustlings** | Exercises from [rustlings.rs](https://rustlings.rs/). | Core Rust syntax & ownership |
